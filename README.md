# Summer Batch

Summer Batch is a lightweight, reliable, efficient, open-source (Summer Batch is distributed under the [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0 "Apache 2 license") ) batch framework for the C# community.

Its design has been driven by the concepts exposed in the [JSR-352](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=352 "jsr-352 spec") specification (which is a java colored but exposes universal batch concepts).

Its purpose is to help users to :

*   migrate smoothly their batch legacy from mainframe to modern Microsoft(R)-based environments;
*   build new batch solutions to be run on Microsoft(R)-based environments.
